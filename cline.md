# Stable Diffusion Prompt Builder Project

## Overview
Created a Python script `main.py` that reads lines from standard input until the sentinel line **THE END** is encountered.  
For each line, the script builds an accumulating description, sends a prompt to Ollama (using the Juggernaut XL v9 model, no LoRA) and outputs a set of Stable Diffusion parameters:

- Positive Stable Diffusion prompt  
- Negative Stable Diffusion prompt  
- CFG Scale  
- Optimum Image Resolution  
- Steps (up to 500)  
- Scheduler (chosen from the allowed list)

The current implementation includes a placeholder `call_ollama` function that generates deterministic dummy data; it can be replaced with a real Ollama API/CLI call.

## Files
- **main.py** – Core script implementing the described functionality (see file content in the repository).

## Task Progress
- [x] Analyze requirements
- [x] Set up necessary files
- [x] Implement main functionality
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Verify results

## Assistant Context
Implemented full support for command‑line file input (concatenating files in the order provided), interactive line‑by‑line mode with `THE END` sentinel, updated the Ollama model to **gemma3:27b**, included the full scheduler list in the prompt, added deterministic placeholder output for fallback, and removed all previous attempts to write context to `cline.md` as requested. The script now prints Ollama’s raw, human‑readable response for each invocation.

## Assistant Context Update (2025-08-24)
- Added the final version of the script with correct model prompt (“Assume model Juggernaut XL v9, no LoRA”) while keeping the CLI call to `gemma3:27b` as required.
- Ensured command‑line file input processes files in the order given and exits without waiting for `THE END`.
- Confirmed interactive mode accumulates lines with newline separation and terminates on `THE END`.
- Removed all code that wrote context to `cline.md` as previously requested.
- Documented all implemented features and remaining TODO items in this file.

## Assistant Context Update (2025-08-24 04:43:00 UTC‑5)
- Saved the assistant’s development context to this file as requested, including the design changes, implementation steps, and reasoning behind each modification.
- Updated the design specification (design.txt) to reflect the dual input modes (interactive and file‑based) and the added instruction to “Use proper weights for drawn elements.”
- Ensured the script’s prompt now includes the weight instruction in both interactive and file modes.
- Confirmed that the model prompt references **Juggernaut XL v9** while the CLI call remains to `gemma3:27b`.
- Verified that no code writes context to `cline.md` during execution, satisfying the user’s earlier request.
- Marked remaining tasks (edge cases, testing, verification) as pending in the task checklist.
