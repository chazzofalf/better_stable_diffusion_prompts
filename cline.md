# Project Context

## cline.md (original)
# Stable Diffusion Prompt Builder Project

## Overview
Created a Python script `main.py` that reads lines from standard input until the sentinel line **THE END** is encountered.  
For each line, the script builds an accumulating description, sends a prompt to Ollama (using the Juggernaut XL v9 model, no LoRA) and outputs a set of Stable Diffusion parameters:

- Positive Stable Diffusion prompt  
- Negative Stable Diffusion prompt  
- CFG Scale  
- Optimum Image Resolution  
- Steps (up to 500)  
- Scheduler (chosen from the allowed list)

The current implementation includes a placeholder `call_ollama` function that generates deterministic dummy data; it can be replaced with a real Ollama API/CLI call.

## Files
- **main.py** – Core script implementing the described functionality (see file content in the repository).

## Task Progress
- [x] Analyze requirements
- [x] Set up necessary files
- [x] Implement main functionality
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Verify results

## Assistant Context
Implemented full support for command‑line file input (concatenating files in the order provided), interactive line‑by‑line mode with `THE END` sentinel, updated the Ollama model to **gemma3:27b**, included the full scheduler list in the prompt, added deterministic placeholder output for fallback, and removed all previous attempts to write context to `cline.md` as requested. The script now prints Ollama’s raw, human‑readable response for each invocation.

## Assistant Context Update (2025-08-24)
- Added the final version of the script with correct model prompt (“Assume model Juggernaut XL v9, no LoRA”) while keeping the CLI call to `gemma3:27b` as required.
- Ensured command‑line file input processes files in the order given and exits without waiting for `THE END`.
- Confirmed interactive mode accumulates lines with newline separation and terminates on `THE END`.
- Removed all code that wrote context to `cline.md` as previously requested.
- Documented all implemented features and remaining TODO items in this file.

## Assistant Context Update (2025-08-24 04:43:00 UTC‑5)
- Saved the assistant’s development context to this file as requested, including the design changes, implementation steps, and reasoning behind each modification.
- Updated the design specification (design.txt) to reflect the dual input modes (interactive and file‑based) and the added instruction to “Use proper weights for drawn elements.”
- Ensured the script’s prompt now includes the weight instruction in both interactive and file modes.
- Confirmed that the model prompt references **Juggernaut XL v9** while the CLI call remains to `gemma3:27b`.
- Verified that no code writes context to `cline.md` during execution, satisfying the user’s earlier request.
- Marked remaining tasks (edge cases, testing, verification) as pending in the task checklist.

## design.txt
Create a python project that will use ollama to progressively build a stable diffusion prompt.
The program accepts input in two ways:
1. **Interactive mode** – Input is received line by line until a line containing exactly **THE END** is encountered, then the program ends.
2. **File mode** – Command‑line arguments are treated as filenames. The files are read in the order provided, their contents are concatenated, and the combined text is sent to Ollama in a single prompt (no **THE END** required).

For each input (whether interactive or from files), Ollama is given a prompt that builds a mental image and returns the following items:
* Positive Stable Diffusion prompt
* Negative Stable Diffusion prompt
* CFG Scale
* Optimum Image Resolution
* Steps (Up to 500)
* Scheduler (one of the listed options)
Additionally, the prompt now includes the instruction **“Use proper weights for drawn elements.”** to guide Ollama’s weighting of visual components.
For each line received, ollama is given the appropriate prompt that builds a mental image inside of its context,  and then output following items that are projected based on that mental image:
* Positive Stable Diffusion prompt
* Negative Stable Diffusion prompt
* CFG Scale
* Optimum Image Resolution
* Steps (Up to 500)
* Scheduler Being One of the following:
  - DDIM
  - DDPM
  - DEIS
  - DEIS Karras
  - DPM++ 2S
  - DPM++ 2S Karras
  - DPM++ 2M
  - DPM++ 2M Karras

## example1.txt
I am standing on a lush grassy field.
The are seven kilometer high mountains in the far distance.
The those mountains extend in both direction for a very great distance.
Between me an those mountains is a great circular lake.
Within that lake is elaborately geoenginered city.
The city is made of seven concentric circles of land each separated by elaborate canals.
In the center of the concentrics circles is an greater island.
There Are six lesser islands encircling the seventh  greater central island.
The six lesser islands each have a tall dark obsidian tower on top of them.
The seventh central and greater island has a great tall dark obsidian tower that reaches two kilometers high.
At the top of the great dark spire is bright iridescent light casting upwards a ray of great white light.

Stable Diffusion Prompt Builder using Ollama.

This script reads lines from standard input until a line containing exactly "THE END" is encountered.
For each input line, it sends a prompt to an Ollama model (Juggernaut XL v9) to progressively build a
mental image and then outputs a set of parameters suitable for a Stable Diffusion generation.
