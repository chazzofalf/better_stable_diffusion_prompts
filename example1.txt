I am standing on a lush grassy field.
The are seven kilometer high mountains in the far distance.
The those mountains extend in both direction for a very great distance.
Between me an those mountains is a great circular lake.
Within that lake is elaborately geoenginered city.
The city is made of seven concentric circles of land each separated by elaborate canals.
In the center of the concentrics circles is an greater island.
There Are six lesser islands encircling the seventh  greater central island.
The six lesser island have a tall dark obsidian spires.
The seventh central and greater island has a great tall dark spire obsidian spire that reaches two kilometers high.
At the top of the great dark spire is bright iridescent light casting upwards a ray of great white light.
